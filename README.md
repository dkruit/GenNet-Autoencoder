# GenNet-Autoencoder
Repository for the autoencoder for genotype data I developed for my thesis project.

The Locally-Directed1D layer used in the model was develped by Arno van Hilten for the GenNet project. For more information see [GenNet: Framework for Interpretable Neural Networks for genetics](https://github.com/ArnovanHilten/GenNet)

Currently contains a Jupyter notebook with a demonstration of the model. I will later add more code.
